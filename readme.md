# Readme

My simple web app, for the purposes of getting to grips with Flask.

## Setup
To install the required packaged run:
```console
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the flask server simply run:
```console
$ ./run.sh
```

It is recommended that you create a secret key, and store it in a file called *secrets.txt*, in this directory.

## References
To run this project, I am following Miguel Grenberg's Flask [tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
